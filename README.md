# Overview
My website is going to be mainly for my mom but one day it is going to be for her clients too. The home page will show some basic features of her company, and then have a link to login. If my mom logs in it will give her access to her inventory as well as show her the form from the email reader. Currently I dont have authentication up and running, but it will be in the future. Right now it is hosted on Render.com. If you wanted to run it in local host you could run npm start and it should run.

The purpose is to solely make my mom's life easier. Doing taxes takes her a while due to having to manually pull the informaton from her receipts, and this puts all of the things she needs for her business in one spot to easily access.

# Web Pages
So i did a basic home page that currently isn't dynamically generating anything, but in the future it will randomly pull recipes from a database i'm going to work on with my mom to have different free ones featured each week. 

The one i also have is an inventory page that will generate a display for everything in her inventory and then she should be able to clikc on an individual item and edit the different features of it.
